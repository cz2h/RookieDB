# Time Consuming Steps:
1. BNLJ:
    1.1 Forgot to set the markNext for backTrackIterator
    1.2 Need to have a way to reset pointers like leftRecord when calling reset.
2. GHJ:
3. Sort:
    3.1 Understand the size of different input. Simple sort requires our input <= #page * pagesize. But for merge
    sort, since we are using buffers as input buffers, we do not necessary limit input size.s
4. minCostJoins:
    Always have prevSet on leftCol (as the deeper one)


# Challenges:
1. BNLJ:
    1.1 Write nested loop into hasNext() design in a pretty way
2. GHJ:
    1.1 Prevent over partitioning when build and prob. Discard left/right, whoever fits into buffer should be used to
    build the maps
